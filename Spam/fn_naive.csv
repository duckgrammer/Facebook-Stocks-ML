151,1,0,"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top - notch management team to bring it all together , rlyc seems to be headed for sunny skies .  this company will not remain below the radar screens of wall street ' s mover shakers or even the average investor for much longer . . . if you are on the lookout for companies that have what it takes to experience rapid growth , but are still trading at rock bottom prices , you should call your financial advisor today about relay capital corp .

682,1,0,"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett -

973,1,0,"Subject: info you requested kcc  thank you for your interest !  judgment coursesoffers an extensive training  course in "" how to collect moneyjudgments ""  if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a  money judgment is and why processing money judgments  can earn you very substantial income .  if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you  will have a money judgment against them .  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the  shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the  judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .  the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser  down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,  real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do  when they are found . the result is that millions of  judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .  in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a  dime .  the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic  proportions . right now in the united states there is  between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney  judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more  judgments take its place .  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have  actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this  business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid  profession in which only a select few will be trained in the  techniques necessary to succeed .  with our first hand experience we have built a course which  teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown  and exciting field of processing money judgments .  by following the steps laid out in our course and with  reasonable effort you can become very successful in the  processing of money judgments .  the income potential is substantial in this profession . we  have associates who have taken our course and are now  working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per  year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00  and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of  their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable  organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business  offices .  today our company and our associates have over 126  million dollars in money judgments that we are currently  processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form  of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .  joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break  even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on  the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting  capability is so extensive that government agencies , police  officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us  for reports .  many of our associates already have real estate liens in  force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .  legally this means that when the properties are sold or  refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %  interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .  annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to  $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the  payment of the principal .  our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per  year . this is just for interest , not counting principle  and not counting the compounding of the interest which can  add substantial additional income . typically companies are  sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest  an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell  their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .  92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %  are women and 36 % are part time .  one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are  not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off  for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are  working on will be there when you return . the judgments  are still in force , they do not disappear .  the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your  computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you  never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you  are . you are not a collection agency .  simply stated the steps to successful money processing  are as follows :  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals  with money judgments .

835,1,0,"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .
